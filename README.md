# Book Recommender System

Designed a Book recommendation system using the Kaggle Goodreads dataset by making use of K-Means clustering and K-Nearest Neighbors Machine Learning algorithm.

K-Means clustering algorithm was used to cluster the data based on the Average Rating and then KNN Algorithm was used to find the nearest neighbours of each data point as the neighboring data points or books would be the most similar to the given book.
